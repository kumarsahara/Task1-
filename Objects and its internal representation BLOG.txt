 Objects and its Internal representation;
 
Objects is most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern javascript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-typesNumber, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol,
in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type.

That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
The variables don’t actually store the value.

objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of
