 Http1&Http2 difference between
  HTTP1; Loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
  -it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast.
  HTTP2; Is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data,
   at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
