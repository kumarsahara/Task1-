Window is the main JavaScript object root,the global object in a browser, 
also can be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
This window object has the morethen the properties.

DOCUMENT
The Document object(DOM) is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. 
What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, 
if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
